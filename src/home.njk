        <strong>ANZAC Day Mass</strong> - Thursday, 25th of April. Mass will be
celebrated at <strong>10am</strong>, using the special text from the
Australian Bishops. The later time will permit those who
would like to go to the South Perth War Memorial at 7am.
The Mass will commence with the Australian National
Anthem. The Australian flags will be in front of the altar,
with springs of wattle and rosemary. All welcome, as we
pray for those
who offered
their lives so
that their
family and
friends would
live. <em>Note that this service will replace the normal 5pm Thursday Mass.</em>
